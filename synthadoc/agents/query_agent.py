        # ── Knowledge gap detection ────────────────────────────────────────────
        # Three independent signals; any one triggers the gap:
        #
        #   1. Page count < 3  — wiki has almost nothing on the topic.
        #
        #   2. Max BM25 score < gap_score_threshold  — pages exist but their
        #      keyword overlap with the query is weak (tunable via
        #      [query] gap_score_threshold in synthadoc.toml; default 2.0).
        #
        #   3. Content overlap < 2  — BM25 scores are corpus-relative and can
        #      be inflated by shared vocabulary even when pages are off-topic
        #      (e.g. spring-flower pages match a vegetables query because both
        #      use words like "spring", "planting", "Canada").  This check
        #      counts how many retrieved pages actually contain at least one
        #      key noun from the question.  Key terms = question words longer
        #      than 4 chars that are not in _STOPWORDS, with trailing
        #      plural/punctuation stripped for basic suffix matching.
        #      If fewer than 2 pages pass this test, the wiki lacks on-topic
        #      content regardless of BM25 scores.
        #

        # which still matched every page in a Canada-focused wiki and made the check
        # useless as a discriminator.  Including "'" in the strip set is safe: it
