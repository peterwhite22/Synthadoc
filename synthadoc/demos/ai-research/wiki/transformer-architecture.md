# Transformer Architecture

The transformer is the dominant neural network architecture for natural language processing
and, increasingly, for vision, audio, and multimodal tasks. Introduced in the 2017 paper
*Attention Is All You Need* by Vaswani et al., it replaced recurrent networks (RNNs and
LSTMs) as the foundation for large-scale language models.

## Core Components

The transformer consists of an encoder-decoder structure, though many modern models use
only the decoder (GPT family) or only the encoder (BERT family).

1. **Tokenisation** — input text is split into subword tokens via BPE or SentencePiece
2. **Embedding layer** — tokens are mapped to dense vectors; positional encodings are added
3. **Multi-head self-attention** — each token attends to all others in the sequence
4. **Feed-forward network** — a two-layer MLP applied position-wise after attention
5. **Layer normalisation** — applied before or after each sub-layer (pre-norm vs post-norm)
6. **Residual connections** — stabilise gradient flow through deep stacks

## Why It Replaced RNNs

RNNs process tokens sequentially, preventing parallelisation during training. The
transformer's self-attention operates over the full sequence in parallel, enabling training
on orders-of-magnitude more data. Long-range dependencies — previously a weakness of RNNs
— are handled directly by [[attention-mechanisms]].

## Key Variants

- **GPT (decoder-only)** — autoregressive, trained to predict the next token
- **BERT (encoder-only)** — masked language modelling, suited for classification tasks
- **T5/BART (encoder-decoder)** — sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation and summarisation

## Scaling and Modern Extensions

The transformer has scaled remarkably well. [[scaling-laws]] established that performance
improves predictably with model size, dataset size, and compute budget. Extensions include
sparse attention for long contexts, mixture-of-experts (MoE) for parameter efficiency, and
rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) for better length generalisation.
