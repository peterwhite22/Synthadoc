# Synthadoc User Quick-Start Guide

**Version: v0.6.0 (Community Edition)**

This guide walks you through the **History of Computing** demo wiki — a fully wired
Synthadoc environment with 13 pre-built pages and six raw source files that cover every
major engine feature. No setup beyond following the steps below is required.

> **Before you start:** complete [README Installation Steps 1–6](../README.md#installation)
> (clone, install, set your API key, install the demo wiki, and start the engine).
> Then come back here.
>
> **Already installed the demo wiki?** Skip `synthadoc install` and run `synthadoc demo sync history-of-computing` instead. This copies any new source files added to the latest demo template into your existing wiki without overwriting anything you have already ingested or modified.

## Step 1 — Verify the demo server has started

If you ran `synthadoc serve -w history-of-computing` or
`synthadoc serve -w history-of-computing --background` in the README, the server
should already be listening on port 7070. Confirm it is up:

```bash
synthadoc status -w history-of-computing
```

Expected output:

```
Wiki:         /home/user/wikis/history-of-computing
Pages:        13
Jobs pending: 0
Jobs total:   0
```

Or probe the health endpoint directly:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7070/health
# → {"status":"ok"}
```

If neither responds, start the server now:

```bash
# Foreground (terminal stays attached — logs stream to console)
synthadoc serve -w history-of-computing

# Background (terminal is released — logs go to wiki log file)
synthadoc serve -w history-of-computing --background
```

![synthadoc serve startup banner](png/synthadoc-serve.png)

The banner confirms the port, wiki path, active LLM provider/model, and PID. If you see
`Warning: TAVILY_API_KEY is not set`, web search (Step 10) will not work — see
[Appendix D — Tavily web search key](#appendix-d--tavily-web-search-key).

If the server does not start, the most common cause is the port already being in use.
Check `<wiki-root>/.synthadoc/config.toml` for `[server] port` and use `--port N` to
override if needed.

> To use Claude Code or Opencode as your LLM provider instead of a direct API key, see [Appendix G](#appendix-g--using-a-coding-tool-as-your-llm-provider).

### Set your active wiki (do this once)

```bash
synthadoc use history-of-computing
```

From this point on, every command in this guide omits `-w history-of-computing` — the active wiki is resolved automatically.

To see which wiki is active at any time:

```bash
synthadoc use
```

## Step 2 — Install the Synthadoc plugin

The plugin ships pre-built — no build step required. Run this command before opening
Obsidian — it copies the plugin files directly into the vault's plugins folder:

```bash
synthadoc plugin install history-of-computing
```

> **Note:** The wiki must be registered first via `synthadoc install` before running
> this command. The installer looks up the wiki's path from the registry.

That's it for the CLI steps. Now open Obsidian.

---

<a name="open-vault"></a>

## Step 3 — Open the vault in Obsidian

**Obsidian must already be installed** — download from **[obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)** if not.

### 1. Open the vault

In Obsidian: **Open folder as vault** → select the installed wiki folder:

- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\wikis\history-of-computing`
- **Linux / macOS:** `~/wikis/history-of-computing`

> **Tip — show all file types:** By default Obsidian hides file types it does not
> natively understand (`.xlsx`, `.pptx`, etc.). To show them: **Settings → Files and
> links → Show all file types → on**.

### 2. Install Dataview

**Dataview** is an Obsidian community plugin that powers the live dashboard in `wiki/dashboard.md`.

1. **Settings** (gear icon, bottom-left) → **Community plugins**
2. Toggle **Turn on community plugins** if it is off
3. Click **Browse** → search `Dataview` → **Install** → **Enable**
4. Close settings

### 3. Enable the Synthadoc plugin

The plugin files are already in place from Step 2. Obsidian just needs to activate them:

1. **Settings → Community plugins** → find **Synthadoc** → toggle **on**
2. Click the gear icon next to the Synthadoc entry
3. Set **Server URL** to `http://127.0.0.1:7070`
4. Close settings

The **Synthadoc ribbon icon** (book icon on the far-left sidebar) confirms the plugin is
active. All Synthadoc commands are reachable via the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P` →
type `Synthadoc`).

![Synthadoc ribbon icon](png/synthadoc-ribbon-icon.png)

![Obsidian vault with pre-built wiki](png/synthadoc-vault-demo.png)

> **Dataview cache:** If the dashboard disagrees with `synthadoc lint report`, drop the
> cache: `Ctrl/Cmd+P` → **Dataview: Drop all cached file metadata**, then reopen the
> dashboard. The CLI report is always authoritative.

<a name="wiki-structure"></a>

## Step 4 — Review the wiki structure and key files

Open the vault explorer. The key files and folders:

```
history-of-computing/
  wiki/                   ← compiled Markdown pages (open these in Obsidian)
    index.md              ← table of contents with [[wikilinks]] to every page
    dashboard.md          ← live Dataview tables — orphans, contradictions, recent pages
    purpose.md            ← scope definition — what belongs in this wiki and what to skip
    overview.md           ← LLM-generated 2-paragraph summary of the entire wiki
    alan-turing.md        ← example pre-built topic page
    grace-hopper.md       ← ...and so on for each of the 13 pre-built pages
  raw_sources/            ← source documents to ingest (PDF, PPTX, XLSX, PNG, MD)
  AGENTS.md               ← LLM instructions — domain guidelines for ingest and query
  log.md                  ← human-readable activity log of every ingest and lint event
  .synthadoc/
    config.toml           ← per-wiki settings (port, LLM provider, cost limits)
    audit.db              ← immutable audit trail (ingest history, costs, events)
    jobs.db               ← job queue (persistent across server restarts)
    cache.db              ← LLM response cache (reduces repeat spend)
```

**Open these files in Obsidian now:**


| File                  | What to look at                                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wiki/index.md`       | Pre-generated category structure with`[[wikilinks]]` to each page |
| `wiki/dashboard.md`   | Live Dataview tables — will populate after Steps 6–8            |
| `wiki/alan-turing.md` | YAML frontmatter:`status`, `confidence`, `tags`, `sources[]`      |
| `AGENTS.md`           | Domain-specific guidelines the LLM reads on every ingest          |
| `wiki/purpose.md`     | In-scope / out-of-scope definition for History of Computing       |

---

<a name="query-wiki"></a>

## Step 5 — Query the pre-built wiki (CLI + Obsidian)

### CLI queries

The wiki already has 13 pages on computing history — query them before ingesting anything:

```bash
synthadoc query "How did Alan Turing influence modern computers?"
synthadoc query "What is Moore's Law and why does it matter?"
synthadoc query "How did Unix influence the open-source movement?"
```

Each answer streams to your terminal token-by-token as the LLM generates it. Citations to source pages appear at the end of the answer. For scripts or pipes that need buffered output, add `--no-stream`:

```bash
synthadoc query "How did Alan Turing influence modern computers?" --no-stream
```

### Compound and multi-part queries

Synthadoc automatically decomposes complex questions into focused sub-queries, retrieves
pages for each part in parallel, then synthesises a single merged answer:

```bash
# Two-part question — decomposes into two independent BM25 searches
synthadoc query "Compare Alan Turing's theoretical contributions with Von Neumann's architectural contributions."

# Multi-hop causal question — automatically decomposed
synthadoc query "How did Moore's Law shape both hardware design and software expectations over time?"
```

The server log shows the decomposition:

```
query decomposed into 2 sub-question(s):
  "Alan Turing theoretical contributions" | "Von Neumann architectural contributions"
```

Simple single-topic questions decompose to one sub-question and behave identically to
a direct query — no extra LLM cost.

> **Slow provider?** Reasoning models (e.g. MiniMax M2.x) can take longer to respond.
> If you see a timeout error, pass `--timeout 120`:
>
> ```bash
> synthadoc query "How did Moore's Law shape hardware design?" --timeout 120
> ```

### Knowledge gap detection

If the wiki does not cover a topic, Synthadoc detects the gap automatically:

```bash
synthadoc query "What is quantum error correction?"
```

Expected output (example):

```
No relevant pages found on this topic.

[!tip] Knowledge Gap Detected
Your wiki doesn't have enough on this topic yet. Enrich it with a web search:

  synthadoc ingest "search for: quantum error correction methods"
  synthadoc ingest "search for: quantum computing hardware qubits"
```

The suggested search strings are generated automatically. Run one of the suggestions
after Step 12 to fill the gap.

![CLI query result with knowledge gap callout](png/cli-gap-detection.png)

### Query from Obsidian

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`) → `Synthadoc: Query: ask the wiki...` → type a
question → press `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`. The answer appears in a responsive modal with
clickable `[[wikilinks]]`.

![Obsidian query modal with answer](png/ui-gap-detection.png)

### Aliases — alternative names for a page

Every wiki page (pre-built or ingest-created) has an `aliases` field in its frontmatter.
It starts empty and is visible in Obsidian's **Properties** panel. Add alternative
names or abbreviations so the query engine can match them without knowing the exact page title.

**Try it now with `wiki/alan-turing.md`:**

1. Open `wiki/alan-turing.md` in Obsidian
2. In the **Properties** panel, click the `aliases` field and add one or more names:

```yaml
---
title: Alan Turing
aliases:
  - Turing
  - father of computer science
  - Turing machine inventor
---
```

3. Save the file, then query using an alias instead of the page title:

```bash
synthadoc query "What did Turing contribute to computing?"
# "Turing" expands to the alan-turing slug before BM25 runs
```

Aliases are matched case-insensitively. Longest match wins — so if two pages each define
an alias and one is a longer substring of the query, the longer one takes precedence.

## Step 6 — Batch ingest all demo sources

The six source files in `raw_sources/` are designed to demonstrate every ingest scenario:


| File                               | Skill      | Scenario                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `turing-enigma-decryption.pdf`     | `pdf`      | **A — Clean merge**: enriches `alan-turing` with Bletchley Park and Bombe detail                                                                                        |
| `computing-pioneers-timeline.xlsx` | `xlsx`     | **A — Clean merge**: structured two-sheet timeline; enriches multiple pages                                                                                             |
| `cs-milestones-overview.pptx`      | `pptx`     | **A — Clean merge + new pages**: 6-slide deck; creates `eniac`, `transistor-and-moores-law`, `internet-history`; enriches `ada-lovelace`, `alan-turing`, `grace-hopper` |
| `first-compiler-controversy.pdf`   | `pdf`      | **B — Conflict**: contradicts `grace-hopper` (A-0 vs FORTRAN dispute)                                                                                                   |
| `quantum-computing-primer.png`     | `image`    | **A — New page**: vision LLM extracts key concepts; creates `quantum-computing`                                                                                         |
| `konrad-zuse-z3-computer.md`       | `markdown` | **C — Orphan**: specific niche topic; creates `konrad-zuse` with no inbound links                                                                                       |

### Run batch ingest

**CLI:**

```bash
synthadoc ingest --batch raw_sources/
```

**Obsidian:** Command Palette → `Synthadoc: Ingest...` → select the **All raw_sources** tab

![Synthadoc Ingest modal — All raw_sources tab queuing source files for batch ingest](png/synthadoc-batch-ingest-raw-sources.png)

Both enqueue one job per file. Watch them:

```bash
synthadoc jobs list
```

![synthadoc jobs list terminal output](png/job-list-terminal.png)

Wait until all six show `completed`. Filter by status if needed:

```bash
synthadoc jobs list --status pending
synthadoc jobs list --status completed
```

Or from Obsidian: Command Palette → `Synthadoc: Jobs...` → use the status-filter checkboxes. The table defaults to newest jobs first; click **Status**, **Operation**, or **Created** headers to re-sort.

![Obsidian Jobs list modal with status filter dropdown](png/synthadoc-jobs-modal.png)

### Verify the results

Once all jobs complete, open **Graph view** (`Ctrl/Cmd+G`) — new nodes appear for the
ingested topics and link into the existing graph.

![Obsidian Graph View after batch ingest](png/synthadoc-graph-after.png)

Run a few queries that use the new content:

```bash
synthadoc query "What was the Bombe machine and who built it?"
synthadoc query "Who invented FORTRAN and when?"
synthadoc query "What did Konrad Zuse contribute to computing history?"
```

> **Pages are created as `draft`.** Every page produced by ingest starts in the `draft` state — compiled but not yet reviewed. Run lint (Step 7) to promote clean pages to `active`.

---

<a name="lint-run"></a>

## Step 7 — Run lint — promote pages to active

Every page created by ingest in Step 6 starts as `draft`. A lint run validates each page — checking for contradictions, orphan pages, and dangling links — and automatically promotes clean pages to `active`.

### 1. Check status before running lint

```bash
synthadoc status
```

Expected output (after batch ingest, before lint):

```
[wiki: history-of-computing]
Wiki:         ~/wikis/history-of-computing
Pages:        18
Jobs pending: 0
Jobs total:   6

Page lifecycle:
  active         0
  draft          5  <- run `synthadoc lint run` to promote
  stale          0
  contradicted   0
  archived       0
```

The 5 `draft` pages are the new pages created by ingest. The 13 pre-built demo pages are not shown yet — they have no lifecycle record until lint runs for the first time and syncs their state.

### 2. Run lint

```bash
synthadoc lint run
synthadoc jobs list           # watch progress
```

Wait until the lint job shows `completed`.

You can also run lint from the Obsidian plugin — open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`) and choose **Synthadoc: Lint: run…**:

![Synthadoc Run Lint panel in Obsidian](png/synthadoc-lint-run.png)

### 3. Check status after lint

```bash
synthadoc status
```

Expected output:

```
[wiki: history-of-computing]
Wiki:         ~/wikis/history-of-computing
Pages:        18
Jobs pending: 0
Jobs total:   7

Page lifecycle:
  active        17
  draft          0
  stale          0
  contradicted   1  <- review required
  archived       0
```

All 5 draft pages were promoted to `active`. The 13 pre-built pages were registered in the lifecycle system for the first time — 12 became `active`, and `grace-hopper` became `contradicted` (see Step 9).

---

<a name="lifecycle"></a>

## Step 8 — Manage page lifecycle

Most knowledge bases treat every page the same — ingested means trusted. Synthadoc is different: every compiled page carries a lifecycle state that reflects whether it has been reviewed, whether its source has changed, and whether a conflict has been detected. Pages you haven't reviewed yet are `draft`. Pages whose source files have been modified since ingest are automatically flagged `stale`. Pages with conflicting sources are marked `contradicted`. Pages whose source has disappeared are `archived`. Every state change — automated or manual — is permanently recorded with who triggered it and why.

> **Differentiation:** RAG pipelines and competing wiki tools have no equivalent concept. They ingest content and serve it forever, with no way to know whether the underlying source is still current, whether two sources contradict each other, or whether a page was ever reviewed. Synthadoc's 5-state lifecycle machine turns your wiki from a static dump into a living, auditable knowledge base.

### Lifecycle states


| State          | Meaning                                   | How it is reached                               | What to do                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `draft`        | Compiled but not yet lint-reviewed        | Automatic on ingest                             | Run lint to auto-promote clean pages       |
| `active`       | Lint-reviewed, current, trusted           | Lint auto-promotes from`draft`                  | No action needed                           |
| `contradicted` | Two or more sources conflict              | Lint detects contradiction automatically        | Re-ingest corrected source, or archive     |
| `stale`        | Source file has changed since last ingest | Lint detects SHA-256 hash mismatch              | Re-ingest the updated source with`--force` |
| `archived`     | Source removed or explicitly retired      | Lint auto-archives on missing source; or manual | Restore to`draft` if source returns        |

### Check lifecycle status (CLI)

```bash
synthadoc status
```

```
Wiki: history-of-computing
  active         18
  draft           0
  stale           0
  contradicted    1
  archived        0
```

### Manage states in Obsidian

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`) → **Synthadoc: Manage Page Lifecycle**. A sortable, filterable table shows every wiki page with its current state, last transition timestamp, and the action buttons valid for that state. Filter by state using the checkboxes at the top, or sort by any column header. Click an action button — a **reason dialog** appears before the transition commits, ensuring every manual change is documented.

![Synthadoc Manage Page Lifecycle modal — one row per page showing current state, last changed timestamp, and action buttons](png/synthadoc-lifecycle-mgmt.png)

Switch to the **Audit Log** tab to see the full history of every state transition across all pages — searchable by slug, filterable by target state, sortable by any column, with pagination.

![Synthadoc Lifecycle Audit Log tab — searchable history of state transitions with From/To state chips, triggered-by, timestamp, and reason columns](png/synthadoc-lifecycle-audit.png)

### Manual state transitions (CLI)

The CLI gives you full control over page state outside of lint automation:

```bash
# Promote a page to active after manual review
synthadoc lifecycle activate alan-turing --reason "reviewed and verified"

# Retire a page whose source has been superseded
synthadoc lifecycle archive alan-turing --reason "replaced by v2 source"

# Restore an archived page back to draft for re-review
synthadoc lifecycle restore alan-turing --reason "source re-added to raw_sources"

# View the full transition history for a page
synthadoc lifecycle log konrad-zuse
```

### Stale detection — local files

If a source file on disk changes after ingest, the next lint run detects the SHA-256 hash mismatch and marks the page `stale`. This catches silent content drift — source documents updated without anyone re-ingesting them.

**Walk-through with the demo wiki:**

1. **Edit the raw source file** — open `raw_sources/konrad-zuse-z3-computer.md` in any text editor. Add a sentence at the very end of the file:

   ```
   Updated: The Z3 blueprint later influenced Plankalkül, Zuse's programming language.
   ```

   Save the file.
2. **Run lint** — the hash mismatch is detected automatically:

   ```bash
   synthadoc lint run
   ```
3. **Find which pages are now stale** — `synthadoc status` shows the counts but not which pages. To see the specific pages, use the **Lifecycle Management** panel in the Obsidian plugin, or run:

   ```bash
   synthadoc lifecycle log --state stale
   ```

   ```
   [wiki: history-of-computing]
   Slug          From    To      By    Timestamp            Reason
   konrad-zuse   active  stale   lint  2026-05-28T18:11:13  source file modified since last ingest
   ```
4. **Inspect the full transition history for the page:**

   ```bash
   synthadoc lifecycle log konrad-zuse
   ```
5. **Resolve staleness** — re-ingest the updated file:

   ```bash
   synthadoc ingest raw_sources/konrad-zuse-z3-computer.md --force
   ```

   The next `synthadoc lint run` returns the page to `active`.

The same mechanism works for any raw source format — markdown, plain text, PDF, DOCX. Once a file is re-ingested, the stored hash updates and lint no longer flags the page as stale.

### URL source availability and freshness

Pages ingested from web URLs or YouTube are also monitored — but these checks are opt-in to avoid adding network calls to every lint run.

**Archived — URL has gone away**

Enable HTTP availability checks with the `--check-urls` flag or a config option:

```bash
synthadoc lint run --check-urls
```

```toml
# config.toml
[lint]
check_url_availability = true
```

When enabled, lint issues an HTTP HEAD request for each URL-sourced page. A 404 or 410 response transitions the page to `archived`. YouTube videos are probed via the transcript system — a deleted or private video triggers `archived`. Network timeouts and other transient errors leave the page unchanged (conservative: no false positives from transient failures).

**Stale — URL content is old**

To flag URL-sourced pages that have not been re-ingested recently:

```toml
[audit]
url_staleness_days = 90   # 0 = never flag (default)
```

When non-zero, lint compares the `ingested_at` timestamp in the audit database to today. Pages older than the threshold are marked `stale`, prompting a re-ingest:

```bash
synthadoc ingest "https://example.com/article" --force
```

### Audit trail

Every state transition — automated by lint or triggered manually — is permanently appended to an immutable event log. The log captures the slug, the previous state, the new state, who triggered the change (`ingest`, `lint`, `cli`, or `api`), the timestamp, and the reason.

```bash
synthadoc lifecycle log konrad-zuse
```

```
[wiki: history-of-computing]
Slug          From    To      By      Timestamp            Reason
konrad-zuse   null    draft   ingest  2026-05-28T14:58:50  new page created by ingest
konrad-zuse   draft   active  lint    2026-05-28T17:54:51  lint passed
konrad-zuse   active  stale   lint    2026-05-28T18:11:13  source file modified since last ingest
konrad-zuse   stale   draft   ingest  2026-05-28T18:30:56  re-ingest of stale page
konrad-zuse   draft   active  lint    2026-05-28T18:31:23  lint passed
```

> For enterprise wikis, this trail answers the compliance questions: "when was this page reviewed, by what process, and why was it changed?" — without requiring anyone to maintain that record manually.

## Step 9 — Resolve a contradiction

After `first-compiler-controversy.pdf` is processed, `wiki/grace-hopper.md` will have:

```yaml
status: contradicted
```

The PDF argues that Hopper's A-0 was a loader rather than a compiler, and that FORTRAN
(1957) was the first production compiler — contradicting the existing page.

**Check via CLI:**

```bash
synthadoc lint report
```

```
Contradicted pages (1) - need review:

  grace-hopper
    -> Open wiki/grace-hopper.md, resolve the conflict, then set status: active
    -> Or re-run: synthadoc lint run --auto-resolve
```

**In Obsidian:** open `wiki/dashboard.md` — `grace-hopper` appears in the
**Contradicted pages** Dataview table. The Properties panel shows `status: contradicted`.

![Dashboard showing contradicted page](png/synthadoc-wiki-conflict.png)

### Option 1 — Manual resolution (recommended first time)

1. Open `wiki/grace-hopper.md` in Obsidian
2. Edit the body to reflect a nuanced view — Hopper pioneered automated code generation
   with A-0; Backus and IBM delivered the first production compiler with FORTRAN in 1957
3. Change `status: contradicted` → `status: active` in the Properties panel
4. Save — the Contradicted pages table clears immediately

### Option 2 — LLM auto-resolve

```bash
synthadoc lint run --auto-resolve
synthadoc jobs status <job-id>
```

The LLM proposes a resolution, appends it as a `**Resolution:**` block, and sets
`status: active`. Review the result in Obsidian and edit if needed.

Or from Obsidian: Command Palette → `Synthadoc: Lint: run with auto-resolve`.

> **Dashboard still showing the contradiction?** Dataview may be serving stale metadata.
> Drop the cache: `Ctrl/Cmd+P` → **Dataview: Drop all cached file metadata**, then reopen
> `dashboard.md`. If `synthadoc lint report` shows "all clear", the file is already
> correct — Dataview just has not caught up yet.

---

<a name="fix-orphan"></a>

## Step 10 — Fix an orphan page

The pre-built demo wiki includes `wiki/ada-lovelace.md`, but no other page links to it.
That makes it an **orphan** — a page with no inbound `[[wikilinks]]`.

**Check via CLI:**

```bash
synthadoc lint report
```

```
Orphan pages (2) - no inbound links:

  ada-lovelace
    -> Add [[ada-lovelace]] to a related content page, e.g.:
         - [[ada-lovelace]] — computing history, programming languages, operating systems, hardware innovation
  quantum-computing-primer
    -> Add [[quantum-computing-primer]] to a related content page, e.g.:
         - [[quantum-computing-primer]] — Quantum Computing Primer
```

**In Obsidian:** open `wiki/dashboard.md` — `ada-lovelace` and `quantum-computing-primer` appear in the **Orphan pages**
Dataview table.

> **Note on Graph view:** Obsidian's Graph view draws edges for both inbound and outbound
> links, so an orphan page that contains its own `[[wikilinks]]` to other pages may appear
> connected. Synthadoc defines an orphan as having **no inbound links** — always use
> `synthadoc lint report` as the authoritative check.

### Option 1 — Link it (recommended)

Open `wiki/programming-languages-overview.md` and add a reference:

```
Ada Lovelace is widely credited as [[ada-lovelace|the first programmer]], having written
the first algorithm intended to be executed by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine in 1843.
```

Save — the orphan disappears from the dashboard immediately.

### Option 2 — Delete and re-ingest later

If the page content quality is poor, delete `wiki/ada-lovelace.md` from Obsidian and
pull in a fresh source via web search:

```bash
synthadoc ingest "search for: Ada Lovelace contributions to computing history"
```

### Deleting a page and cleaning up its references

When you delete a wiki page from Obsidian, any `[[wikilinks]]` pointing to it in other
pages become dangling references. Run lint to remove them automatically:

```bash
synthadoc lint run
```

Lint scans every page for links whose target no longer exists:

- **List items** whose only content is the dangling link are removed entirely, e.g.
  `- [[deleted-page]] — some description` disappears from the page.
- **Inline references** such as `as described in [[deleted-page]]` are unlinked — the
  brackets are stripped and the display text is kept.

The number of pages cleaned up is shown in the lint output and recorded in `log.md`.

---

<a name="adversarial-review"></a>

## Step 11 — Run the adversarial review

Standard lint validates wiki structure — contradictions, orphan pages, dangling links. The
**adversarial review** adds a second independent LLM pass that interrogates every page for
epistemic overreach: overstated claims, unsupported assertions, and high-confidence statements
the source material does not support.

The adversarial review runs automatically as part of every `synthadoc lint run`. No extra flag is
needed.

### Run lint with adversarial review

```bash
synthadoc lint run
synthadoc jobs list           # watch progress
synthadoc lint report         # view results when complete
```

The pre-built pages already contain the kinds of sweeping historical claims an adversarial
reviewer will flag — no additional ingest is needed before this step, though running Step 6
first gives the adversarial review more content to work with.

The reviewer flags **up to 2 issues per page by default** (configurable via `adversarial_max_per_page` in `config.toml`) and only flags claims it is highly confident
about — defensible or nuanced statements are skipped. The full history-of-computing demo
wiki (13 pre-built pages plus pages created in Step 6) typically produces **10–15 warnings**,
giving a meaningful but not overwhelming signal.

Sample output for the history-of-computing demo wiki (after Step 6 batch ingest; exact
wording varies by LLM):

```
Contradicted pages (0)
Orphan pages (0)

Adversarial warnings (3):

  alan-turing
    Claim:   "Saved over fourteen million lives."
    Concern: This specific figure lacks scholarly consensus — historians dispute both any
             precise death-count and the causal attribution of lives saved to Turing's
             cryptanalysis alone. The claim conflates a speculative timeline reduction with
             a precise casualty figure that is unsupported in academic literature.

  artificial-intelligence-history
    Claim:   "These systems exhibit emergent capabilities that were not explicitly programmed."
    Concern: "Emergence" in large language models is disputed — several researchers argue
             that capability gains are smooth and predictable at scale, and that the label
             "emergent" reflects measurement choices rather than a genuine phase transition.

  personal-computer-revolution
    Claim:   "IBM's decision to build the PC from off-the-shelf parts ... was the most
             consequential business decision of the era."
    Concern: An unsupported superlative — Microsoft's retention of the MS-DOS licence and
             Intel's exclusive CPU supply deal were equally pivotal; "most consequential"
             requires a comparison the text does not make.
```

> **Note:** Re-ingest suggestions only appear for pages whose sources were ingested from local
> files (absolute paths) or URLs. Pre-built demo pages use placeholder source references,
> so no re-ingest command is shown — use `synthadoc ingest <source>` manually if needed.

### What each warning means

Each adversarial warning has two parts:


| Field       | Meaning                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claim**   | The exact sentence or phrase flagged as potentially problematic |
| **Concern** | Why the adversarial reviewer flagged it — the specific doubt   |

The adversarial LLM is deliberately skeptical. Not every warning requires action — some claims
are defensible with context the LLM does not have. Read each concern before deciding what to do.

### What to do with a warning


| Situation                                              | Action                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claim is accurate, concern is addressed by other pages | Do nothing — the wiki is fine                                             |
| Claim is a genuine overstatement                       | Edit the page in Obsidian and soften the language                          |
| Source has been updated since last ingest              | Re-ingest with`--force` to bypass dedup: `synthadoc ingest <file> --force` |
| Claim needs a counterbalancing perspective             | Ingest a different source:`synthadoc ingest <other-source>`                |
| Page quality is poor overall                           | Delete the page and re-ingest:`synthadoc ingest <new-source>`              |

> **Re-ingesting the same unchanged source won't fix an overstatement.** The LLM will read
> the same text and likely produce the same claim. For overstatements, edit the page directly
> in Obsidian. Use `--force` only when the source document itself has new or updated content.

### Hands-on exercise

The `alan-turing` warning flags the "fourteen million lives" figure as lacking scholarly
consensus. Fix it:

1. Open `wiki/alan-turing.md` in Obsidian
2. Find the sentence in the **Wartime Contributions** section that mentions lives saved
   (added when you ingested `turing-enigma-decryption.pdf` in Step 6)
3. Remove the specific casualty figure and replace with qualified language:
   ```
   Historians credit Turing's Bombe with dramatically accelerating Allied codebreaking,
   though estimates of the war's duration and lives affected vary widely across sources.
   ```
4. Save — the next lint run will re-evaluate the page and the warning will clear

### Verify the warning cleared

```bash
synthadoc lint run
synthadoc lint report
```

The `alan-turing` adversarial warning should no longer appear.

### View warnings in Obsidian

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`) → `Synthadoc: Lint: report` → click the
**Adversarial** tab. Flagged claims and the **⚠** icon appear in **orange** so warnings
stand out immediately. The **Concern:** label is also orange; the concern text itself is
muted for readability. Suggested re-ingest commands appear below each entry.

The same label-coloring convention applies across all tabs: **Why flagged:** in the
Contradictions tab uses orange, and **Suggested index entry:** in the Orphans tab uses
accent blue (it is a suggestion, not a warning), so you can scan the full report at a
glance without reading every line.

![Synthadoc Lint report — Adversarial tab showing flagged claims across multiple pages](png/lint-report-adversarial.png)

> **Skip the adversarial pass:** If you want a fast structural-only lint, open
> `Synthadoc: Lint: run...` and tick **Skip adversarial review**. This also clears any
> existing `lint_warnings` from frontmatter so stale warnings do not linger.

### Optional — adjust the warning cap

By default the adversarial reviewer flags at most 2 issues per page. Raise the cap for a thorough audit; lower it to reduce noise on large wikis:

```toml
# config.toml
[lint]
adversarial_max_per_page = 2  # raise to 3–5 for a deeper review; lower to 1 for less noise
```

If `[lint]` is absent from `config.toml`, Synthadoc defaults to 2 — no file change needed.

### Optional — appoint a dedicated judge model

By default the adversarial review shares the lint model. The most effective configuration is a
*different provider entirely*: a model from a distinct family, trained on different data with
different inductive biases, will surface blind spots and challenge assumptions that the primary
model would systematically miss. Same-model self-review has limited value; cross-model review
does not:

```toml
# config.toml
[agents]
lint        = { provider = "minimax",   model = "MiniMax-M2.5" }
adversarial = { provider = "anthropic", model = "claude-sonnet-4-6" }   # independent judge — different model family, different inductive biases
```

The two providers are intentionally different — when a model from one family reviews the
output of a model from another, neither shares the training-induced assumptions that cause
same-model review to miss systematic errors.

## Step 12 — Web search ingestion

> **Requires `TAVILY_API_KEY`** — see [Appendix D](#appendix-d--tavily-web-search-key).
> Without it, web search jobs fail with `[ERR-SKILL-004]`. All other features work normally.

### How web search decomposition works

Synthadoc **decomposes web search topics** into multiple focused keyword sub-queries
before hitting Tavily. Each sub-query fires a separate parallel search, URLs are
deduplicated across all results, and each is enqueued as an individual ingest job.
This produces richer, more targeted pages than a single broad search.

```
Input: "search for: history of ARPANET and internet origins"

Server log:
  web search decomposed into 3 queries:
    "ARPANET creation 1969 DARPA" | "TCP/IP protocol development history" | "internet origins packet switching"

Result: 3 parallel Tavily searches → ~60 URLs ingested vs ~20 from a single search
```

Decomposition falls back gracefully — if the LLM call fails, the original phrase is used as
a single query and the ingest always completes.

### Run a web search ingest

```bash
synthadoc ingest "search for: Dennis Ritchie C programming language Bell Labs history"
synthadoc ingest "search for: ENIAC first general purpose electronic computer history"
```

Each command fans out to up to 20 URL ingest jobs. The commands return immediately —
all processing happens in the background. Watch progress with:

```bash
synthadoc jobs list
```

> **How long does it take?**
>
> - **Free-tier Gemini (15 RPM) or Groq:** Two searches produce ~20–40 LLM calls. The
>   server retries automatically when the rate limit is hit (you will see
>   `Rate limit (429) — waiting 60 s` in the server log — this is normal). Expect
>   **3–8 minutes** for both searches to fully complete.
> - **Paid tier (Gemini paid, MiniMax, Anthropic, OpenAI):** No rate-limit retries.
>   Both searches typically finish in **under 2 minutes**.

Pages such as `dennis-ritchie`, `eniac-history`, and related topics will be created or
enriched. The `wiki/overview.md` page is regenerated automatically after each batch
completes.

### Control the scope

Limit how many URLs are enqueued (default: 20):

```bash
synthadoc ingest "search for: quantum computing IBM Google" --max-results 5
```

**Batch via manifest file:** the demo wiki ships a `sources.txt` at the wiki root (outside `raw_sources/` — a `.txt` inside that folder would be treated as a text document rather than a manifest). It already contains these web search entries alongside YouTube and PDF sources:

```
search for: Dennis Ritchie C programming language Bell Labs history
find on the web: Linus Torvalds Linux kernel creation 1991
search for: Ada Lovelace first programmer Analytical Engine Babbage
look up: history of ARPANET and internet origins
```

Ingest all sources at once:

```bash
synthadoc ingest --file sources.txt
```

### Web search from Obsidian — live view

Open the Command Palette → `Synthadoc: Ingest... → web search tab`:

1. Type a topic — e.g. `Linus Torvalds Linux kernel creation 1991`
2. Set **Max results** (1–50, default 20) to control scope
3. Adjust **Poll interval** if desired (default: 2000 ms)
4. Press `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` or click **Search**

The modal transitions to a live view:

- **Searching the web…** — while Tavily fetches
- **Found N URLs — ingesting…** — as fan-out jobs are created
- **Ingesting N URLs… (M done)** — counting completed child jobs
- A **Pages** list grows in real time as each URL ingest completes
- **Errors** (blocked domains, 404s) appear in red
- **Done — N page(s) written.** when all jobs settle

![Obsidian web search live view](png/synthadoc-search-live-view.png)

The modal prepends `search for:` automatically — just type the topic, no prefix needed.

---

<a name="youtube-ingest"></a>

## Step 13 — Ingest a YouTube video

Pass any YouTube URL directly — the transcript is extracted automatically from the
YouTube caption system (no API key, no audio download). Both the full URL and the
short-link form (`https://youtu.be/...`) are accepted:

```bash
synthadoc ingest "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5nskjZ_GoI"
```

This ingests *Early Computing: Crash Course Computer Science #1*, which covers Hollerith,
Babbage, Lovelace, and the first programmable machines — a natural fit for the demo wiki.
The YouTube entries in `sources.txt` (see Step 10) include this video, so running
`synthadoc ingest --file sources.txt` handles it alongside the web searches.

The wiki page opens with an **executive summary** — a brief description of what the video
covers, the main topics as bullet points, and the key takeaway — so you can assess
relevance at a glance. The full timestamped transcript follows for precise cross-referencing.

> **Captions required** — the video must have captions (auto-generated or manually added).
> Check by opening the video on YouTube → `...` → **Show transcript**. If no transcript
> panel appears, the source is skipped with a warning and ingestion continues.

> **Short vs. long videos** — short videos produce a single wiki page. Long videos are
> chunked automatically by the existing `max_pages_per_ingest` limit.

Watch progress:

```bash
synthadoc jobs list
```

> **Tavily search + YouTube** — if Tavily returns YouTube URLs as web search results, they
> are automatically routed to the YouTube transcript skill. No extra steps needed.

---

<a name="scaffold"></a>

## Step 14 — Enrich the wiki with scaffold

After batch ingest, the wiki has grown from 10 pre-built pages to 12 or more. **Scaffold**
reads the current wiki state and uses the LLM to regenerate the structure files —
`wiki/index.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `wiki/purpose.md` — so they reflect what the wiki has
actually become. Existing pages that are already linked in `index.md` are detected as
**protected slugs** and preserved; only unlinked and new categories are refreshed.

### Run scaffold

```bash
synthadoc scaffold
```

Expected output:

```
Reading current wiki content…
Generating domain-specific scaffold (History of Computing)…
  Protected slugs: alan-turing, grace-hopper, von-neumann-architecture, unix-history, … (10 pages)
  Scaffold complete — domain-specific content generated.
wiki/index.md updated
AGENTS.md updated
wiki/purpose.md updated
```

Open `wiki/index.md` in Obsidian — it now has richer category headings that reflect the
full post-ingest wiki (e.g. **Pioneers and Visionaries**, **Hardware Milestones**,
**Software and Languages**, **European Computing**, **Emerging Technology**).

### Re-run scaffold at any time

As the wiki grows, re-running scaffold keeps the index structure current:

```bash
synthadoc scaffold
```

`config.toml` and `dashboard.md` are **never touched** by scaffold.

### Schedule scaffold automatically

To keep the index fresh without manual intervention:

```bash
# Weekly scaffold refresh — every Sunday at 4 AM
synthadoc schedule add --op "scaffold" --cron "0 4 * * 0"
```

### Protect custom content with the scaffold marker

By default, re-running scaffold rewrites the entire `index.md`. If you want to add your own
intro text, notes, or links that survive future scaffold runs, add the marker on its own line:

```markdown
My custom wiki intro — maintained by hand.

<!-- synthadoc:scaffold -->

## Pioneers and Visionaries
- [[alan-turing]]
...
```

Everything **above** the marker is your protected zone — scaffold never touches it.
Everything **below** is rewritten each time. If the marker is absent, scaffold rewrites
the whole file as before.

---

<a name="audit"></a>

## Step 15 — Audit features

The `synthadoc audit` commands query the append-only `audit.db` — no `sqlite3` required.

### Ingest history

```bash
synthadoc audit history
```

Shows the last 50 ingest records: timestamp, source file, wiki pages created/updated,
token count, and cost. Use `--limit N` (or `-n N`) for more records and `--json` for machine-readable output.

![synthadoc audit history output](png/synthadoc-audit-history.png)

### Cost summary

```bash
synthadoc audit cost
```

Expected output:

```
Period: last 30 days
Total tokens : 22,400
Total cost   : $0.143
Sources processed: 6
Avg cost/source  : $0.024
```

Pass `--days 7` for a weekly view. Per-model cost tracking is fully live in v0.2.0.

![synthadoc audit cost output](png/synthadoc-audit-cost.png)

### Query history

```bash
synthadoc audit queries
```

Shows recent questions asked, how many sub-questions each was decomposed into, token
usage, and per-query cost. Especially useful after running the compound queries in Step 5.

![synthadoc audit queries — query history table showing questions, sub-question count, tokens, and cost](png/audit-queries.png)

### Audit events

```bash
synthadoc audit events
```

Expected after Steps 6–10:

```
2026-04-21 10:12  contradiction_found   grace-hopper ← first-compiler-controversy.pdf
2026-04-21 10:14  auto_resolved         grace-hopper (confidence: 0.91)
```

Records every contradiction detection, auto-resolution, and cost gate trigger.

![synthadoc audit events output](png/synthadoc-audit-events.png)

---

<a name="scheduling"></a>

## Step 16 — Scheduling recurring operations

Hooks react to events that already happened. The scheduler goes the other direction —
it proactively triggers operations on a timer, keeping the wiki fresh automatically.

### Register a nightly batch ingest

```bash
synthadoc schedule add \
  --op "ingest --batch raw_sources/" \
  --cron "0 2 * * *" \
 
```

This registers a 2 AM daily ingest directly with the OS scheduler (`crontab` on
macOS/Linux, Task Scheduler on Windows). No background daemon required.

### Register a weekly lint pass + weekly scaffold refresh

```bash
synthadoc schedule add --op "lint run" --cron "0 3 * * 0"
synthadoc schedule add --op "scaffold" --cron "0 4 * * 0"
```

### Verify

```bash
synthadoc schedule list
```

Expected output — each row now shows the schedule, next run time, last run, and last result:

```
ID                   Schedule           Next Run             Last Run             Last Result    Command
sched-a3f1b2c4       0 2 * * *          2026-05-31 02:00     —                    —              synthadoc ... schedule run --op "ingest --batch raw_sources/"
sched-b7e9d012       0 3 * * 0          2026-06-01 03:00     —                    —              synthadoc ... schedule run --op "lint run"
sched-c9f3e201       0 4 * * 0          2026-06-01 04:00     —                    —              synthadoc ... schedule run --op "scaffold"
```

Next run time is computed from the cron expression on macOS/Linux, and read from the OS Task Scheduler on Windows.

### Check run history

Each time a scheduled job fires, the outcome (status, duration, and any output or error) is recorded in the schedule history log. View recent runs:

```bash
synthadoc schedule history
```

```
Run ID               Op              Started              Duration    Status
------------------------------------------------------------------------
run-a1b2c3d4         lint run        2026-05-31 03:00       47.3s    success
run-342a7e95         ingest          2026-05-30 23:11        0.8s    failed
run-bc56dc6a         scaffold        2026-05-30 23:04       31.2s    success

Details
-------
run-a1b2c3d4  lint run  success
  Checked 47 pages. 2 adversarial warnings. 0 orphan pages.

run-342a7e95  ingest  failed
  exit code 1: MINIMAX_API_KEY is not set

run-bc56dc6a  scaffold  success
  Scaffold complete — domain-specific content generated.
```

The **Details** section only appears when runs have output to show. Successful runs display captured output; failed runs display the error. A `failed` run means either `synthadoc serve` was not running when the task fired, or the operation itself encountered an error. Re-run manually with `synthadoc schedule run --op "lint run"` to recover.

### Clean up (demo only)

Remove the scheduled jobs so they do not run after the demo:

```bash
synthadoc schedule remove sched-a3f1b2c4
synthadoc schedule remove sched-b7e9d012
synthadoc schedule remove sched-c9f3e201
```

> **Production use:** for always-on scheduling, run `synthadoc serve` as a background
> service (systemd, launchd, or Windows Service) so the server is available when the OS
> fires the scheduled task. If a run is missed (server down or machine asleep), it will
> not automatically retry — check `synthadoc schedule history` for failures and re-run
> manually if needed.

---

<a name="routing"></a>

## Step 17 — Set up ROUTING.md — scoped search

As your wiki grows, BM25 searches the full corpus for every query. **ROUTING.md** groups pages
into named topic branches so queries only search the most relevant slice — reducing noise,
improving retrieval precision, and significantly cutting search latency on large wikis (see
[Appendix H](#appendix-h--bm25-routing-performance-benchmarks) for measured results).

![ROUTING.md scoped query flow](png/synthadoc-routing.png)

### Generate ROUTING.md from your current index

```bash
synthadoc routing init
```

This reads the `## Section` headings in `wiki/index.md` and writes `ROUTING.md` at the wiki
root. Example output:

```
ROUTING.md created — 5 branches, 12 slugs.
```

Open `ROUTING.md` — it looks like this:

```markdown
## Pioneers and Visionaries
- [[alan-turing]]
- [[grace-hopper]]
- [[ada-lovelace]]

## Hardware Milestones
- [[eniac]]
- [[von-neumann-architecture]]
```

### Manage routing in Obsidian

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`) → **Synthadoc: Routing: manage ROUTING.md**. The modal shows the current ROUTING.md content and three actions: **Init** (generate from index.md), **Validate** (report dangling slugs and duplicates), and **Clean** (remove dangling entries).

![Synthadoc routing modal — ROUTING.md initialised, showing branch count confirmation and file content preview](png/synthadoc-routing-init.png)

### Edit and extend

Add new branches or move slugs by hand. ROUTING.md is just a Markdown file — the format is
`## BranchName` headings with `- [[slug]]` entries. Each slug should appear in exactly one branch.

If you accidentally list the same slug under two branches, the search result is still correct — `bm25_search` converts the scoped slug list to a set before scoring, so the page is never double-counted. However, the branch assignment becomes ambiguous: a query that picks either branch will find the page regardless of which one was intended. Use `routing validate` to catch these duplicates before they cause confusion.

### Validate and clean

After deleting wiki pages, some slugs in ROUTING.md may dangle. `routing validate` also reports slugs that appear in more than one branch:

```bash
synthadoc routing validate   # report dangling slugs and cross-branch duplicates (dry run)
synthadoc routing clean      # remove dangling slugs
```

Example output when a duplicate is found:

```
Issues in ROUTING.md (1):
  [Hardware]  [[alan-turing]] (duplicate — also in 'People')
```

Fix by removing the entry from the branch where it does not belong, then re-run `validate` to confirm.

### How it works at query time

When the server receives a query it asks the LLM to pick the 1-2 most relevant branches,
then restricts BM25 to only those slugs. If no branch is clearly relevant it falls back to
full-corpus search automatically.

New pages created by ingest are auto-placed into the most appropriate branch.

<a name="staging"></a>

## Step 18 — Configure candidates staging

By default, every ingested source that produces a new page writes it directly to `wiki/`.
**Candidates staging** lets you review new pages before they influence queries and lint.

### Enable staging

```bash
synthadoc staging policy threshold
```

With `threshold` policy, pages whose confidence is below the minimum go to
`wiki/candidates/` instead of `wiki/`. The default minimum is `high`:

```bash
# Lower the bar — medium-confidence pages also go to candidates/
synthadoc staging policy threshold --min-confidence medium
```

Or stage everything for full manual review:

```bash
synthadoc staging policy all
```

Changes take effect on the next ingest job — no server restart needed.

### Review candidates after an ingest run

```bash
synthadoc candidates list
```

Example output:

```
Candidates (3):
  early-internet-history           confidence: medium   ingested: 2026-05-06T14:22:11
  punch-card-era                   confidence: low      ingested: 2026-05-06T14:22:45
  vacuum-tube-computers            confidence: medium   ingested: 2026-05-06T14:23:01
```

![Candidates list in Obsidian](png/synthadoc-candidates.png)

### Promote or discard

```bash
synthadoc candidates promote early-internet-history   # move to wiki/
synthadoc candidates discard punch-card-era           # delete
synthadoc candidates promote --all                    # promote everything
```

### Manage staging from Obsidian

**Set the policy** — Command Palette → `Synthadoc: Staging: manage staging policy...`:

- The modal shows the current policy in plain language at the top.
- Click **Off**, **All**, or **Threshold** in the segmented control.
- When **Threshold** is selected, a second control appears — pick **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** as the minimum confidence.
- Click **Save**. The status block updates immediately to confirm the change.
- Click **Candidate pages →** at the bottom of the modal to jump straight to the Candidates panel.

**Review and promote candidates** — Command Palette → `Synthadoc: Candidates: review candidate pages...`:

- The modal lists every staged page with its slug, colour-coded confidence badge, and ingest timestamp.
- Check individual rows and click **Promote Selected** or **Discard Selected**.
- Use **Promote All** or **Discard All** to act on every candidate at once.
- The table reloads after each action, so the count stays current.
- Click **← Staging policy** at the bottom to jump back to the Staging modal.

### Turn staging off

```bash
synthadoc staging policy off
```

Or from Obsidian: `Synthadoc: Staging: manage staging policy...` → select **Off** → **Save**.

## Step 19 — Build a context pack

A **context pack** is a token-bounded evidence bundle assembled from the wiki. It decomposes your goal into sub-questions, runs parallel BM25 searches across the wiki, and packs the highest-scoring excerpts into a single cited Markdown document within a token budget.

### Build a pack from the CLI

```bash
synthadoc context build "early computing pioneers"
```

Output is Markdown printed to the terminal:

```markdown
# Context Pack: early computing pioneers
Generated: 2026-05-07T09:14:22
Token budget: 4000 | Used: 1823

---

## Omitted — token budget exceeded
- [[charles-babbage]] — ~420 tokens
- [[john-von-neumann]] — ~390 tokens
```

Each entry is cited with its source page, confidence, and tags. Pages that did not fit within the budget are listed in the omitted section.

### Use cases

**Feed into an external LLM prompt** — paste the terminal output directly into Claude.ai, ChatGPT, or any other chat interface as grounded context before asking a question:

```bash
synthadoc context build "transistor history and Moore's Law" | pbcopy   # macOS — copies to clipboard
```

**Save next to a document you are writing** — keep the evidence bundle alongside your draft:

```bash
synthadoc context build "early computing pioneers" --output ~/drafts/computing-brief.md
```

**Pipe into another CLI tool** — chain with any tool that reads from stdin:

```bash
synthadoc context build "Von Neumann architecture" --output /tmp/ctx.md
llm -f /tmp/ctx.md "write a 500-word article based on this"
```

### Adjust the token budget

```bash
synthadoc context build "early computing pioneers" --tokens 2000
```

Set a permanent default in `config.toml`:

```toml
[query]
context_token_budget = 6000
```

<a name="claim-provenance"></a>

## Step 20 — Establish claim-level provenance

Every compiled wiki page is a synthesis — the LLM draws on source text and rewrites it as prose. **Claim-level provenance** closes the audit gap: during ingest, a dedicated annotation pass inserts a `^[filename:L-L]` citation marker at the end of each substantive paragraph, mapping the compiled claim to the exact line range in the raw source that supports it. Markers are stored in the page body, validated by lint, and recorded in the audit database. In Obsidian they render as interactive chips — one click opens the Source Viewer, showing the referenced lines with surrounding context. For PDF sources, a pagemap sidecar resolves the line number to the correct page for direct navigation.

### Re-ingest sources to generate citations

Citation markers are injected during ingest. The demo wiki ships with pre-compiled page stubs — static content that was never run through the annotation pass. When you ran Step 6, Synthadoc annotated only the sections it synthesised during that run; the pre-built stub content was not touched. To get full citation coverage across the entire page, you need to re-synthesise from scratch — but because the source files have not changed since Step 6, the normal dedup check would skip them. The **Force re-ingest** option bypasses the duplicate check so every file runs through the full pipeline including the citation annotation pass, regardless of whether it was previously ingested.

**From the Obsidian plugin (recommended):**

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`) → **Synthadoc: Ingest sources**
2. Switch to the **All raw_sources** tab
3. Check **Force re-ingest (skip duplicate check)**
4. Click **Ingest all**

All supported files in your `raw_sources/` folder are queued immediately. You can watch progress under **Jobs** in the Obsidian command palette or with:

```bash
synthadoc jobs list
```

Wait until all jobs reach `completed` status before checking for citation markers.

**Why --force is needed:** Synthadoc records a hash of every ingested source file in the audit database. On subsequent ingest of the same unchanged file, the hash matches and the job is skipped — this is intentional to avoid redundant LLM calls. `--force` overrides this check so the annotation pass runs even on previously seen files.

### Inspect citation chips in Reading View

Once the re-ingest jobs complete, open any wiki page in **Reading View** (`Ctrl/Cmd+E`, or click the book icon in the top-right toolbar). Citation chips are rendered by a post-processor that only runs in Reading View — they will not appear in Edit or Live Preview mode. Paragraphs that make a substantive claim now end with an inline citation chip:

```
Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test in 1950.^[turing-biography.txt:12-24]
```

Click a chip to open the **Source Viewer** — the exact lines from the source file, highlighted, with ±5 lines of context. For PDF sources, a **"Open PDF at page N →"** button resolves the line number to the correct PDF page via a pagemap sidecar and opens it in Obsidian's native PDF viewer.

![Synthadoc citation chips on the alan-turing wiki page — each chip links to the exact source lines](png/claim-level-citation.png)

### Audit provenance across the whole wiki

Open the Obsidian command palette → **Synthadoc: View Page Provenance**. A sortable, paginated table shows every citation across the wiki. You can drag the modal by its title bar to reposition it, and all cell content can be selected and copied. Sort by source file to audit a single document, or filter by slug to see all claims for one page. Click any row to open the Source Viewer for that citation's exact line range.

![Page Provenance modal showing citation table with a Source Viewer popup open for a PDF row — pagination is pinned below the table](png/page-provenance-line-range.png)

### Find broken citations

```bash
# CLI — show citations that failed validation
synthadoc audit citations --broken

# All citations for one page
synthadoc audit citations --page alan-turing
```

![CLI output of audit citations for the alan-turing page — table of source file, line range, and claim excerpt for every recorded citation](png/audit-citation.png)

The lint report also shows a **Citation Issues** section listing any broken, out-of-range, or malformed markers:

```bash
synthadoc lint report
```

---

## Step 21 — Export your wiki

Synthadoc exports your wiki in four machine-readable formats — all assembled server-side from cached data with **zero additional LLM calls**. Use exports to feed reviewed knowledge to an external AI assistant, load your wiki's link structure into a graph analysis tool, or integrate page content into an agent pipeline. Because exports respect the lifecycle filter, you can choose to export only `active` pages — the ones that have passed lint review — rather than everything that has ever been ingested.

> **Differentiation:** Unlike static document exports from other tools, Synthadoc's exports carry the full provenance chain. The `json` format includes the exact source lines that support every claim, the complete state transition history for each page, and the API cost that was spent compiling it. No other knowledge base tool produces an export this rich.

### What each format contains


| Format          | What it exports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Best used for                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `llms.txt`      | Page titles + one-line summaries, structured per the[llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org) spec. Contradicted/stale pages appear in a **Needs Review** section; archived pages are omitted.                                                           | Feeding AI assistants a compact, navigable wiki index            |
| `llms-full.txt` | Full page content for all pages, separated by`---` dividers, with status and confidence headers. Provenance footnotes (`^[source.txt:42-58]`) are preserved verbatim. No size limit.                                                              | Large-context LLM prompts, RAG pipelines, offline reading        |
| `graphml`       | Directed wikilink graph — one node per page, one edge per`[[wikilink]]`. Each node carries the page title, lifecycle state, confidence level, orphan flag, inbound link count, and routing branch. Compatible with yEd, Gephi, and Cytoscape.    | Visualising knowledge structure, detecting hub pages and orphans |
| `json`          | Full structured dump per page: content, tags, sources, claims with source line ranges, lifecycle transition history, routing branch, and per-page ingest cost and token usage. Wiki-level: total compilation cost and routing branch memberships. | Agent pipelines, programmatic processing, compliance audits      |

### Status filter — export only what you trust

The `--status` flag scopes the export to a specific lifecycle state:


| Value           | What is included                  | When to use it                                                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `all` (default) | Every non-archived page           | Full snapshot                                                                     |
| `active`        | Only lint-reviewed, trusted pages | **Recommended for AI consumption** — avoids feeding unreviewed content to an LLM |
| `draft`         | Pages awaiting first lint pass    | Reviewing what has been ingested but not yet approved                             |
| `stale`         | Pages whose source has changed    | Identifying content that needs re-ingest                                          |
| `contradicted`  | Pages with detected conflicts     | Targeted review of known issues                                                   |
| `archived`      | Retired pages                     | Audit or recovery                                                                 |

### CLI

Run from your wiki root so `--output exports/…` writes inside your Obsidian vault.

```bash
# Active pages only — compact index of trusted knowledge (llms.txt spec)
synthadoc export --format llms.txt --status active

# All pages — full content with provenance footnotes preserved
synthadoc export --format llms-full.txt --output exports/history-full.txt

# Wikilink graph — open in yEd, Gephi, or Cytoscape
synthadoc export --format graphml --output exports/history.graphml

# Agent-ready JSON — claims, lifecycle history, per-page cost, routing
synthadoc export --format json --output exports/history.json
```

**Flags:** `--format/-f` (required: `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `graphml`, `json`), `--output/-o` (path relative to CWD; omit to print to stdout), `--status/-s` (default `all`).

Requires `synthadoc serve` to be running.

### In Obsidian

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`) → **Synthadoc: Export Wiki**.

The modal opens with a description panel explaining each format, a format dropdown, a full-width output path field (pre-filled with today's date and the correct file extension), and a status filter. Click **Export** — the file is written to your vault's `exports/` folder and opened automatically.

![Synthadoc Export Wiki modal — format dropdown, description panel, output path field, status filter, and Export button](png/synthadoc-export-wiki.png)

When **GraphML** is selected, a **View Graph** button appears. Click it for an inline Cytoscape.js preview of your wiki's link structure before saving to file.

![Synthadoc inline knowledge graph viewer — nodes represent wiki pages, edges represent wikilinks, with a View Graph preview inside Obsidian](png/synthadoc-export-kg.png)

### What makes the JSON export unique

Open `exports/history.json` and inspect any page entry. You will find fields no other wiki export tool produces:

- **`claims[]`** — every annotated paragraph linked to the exact source lines that support it (`source_file`, `line_start`, `line_end`, `claim_excerpt`). Not "cited from X" — but "line 42–58 of X."
- **`lifecycle_history[]`** — the complete state transition log for this page: from/to state, timestamp, triggered by, and reason. You can audit exactly when a page was reviewed and how it got to its current state.
- **`ingest_cost_usd` / `ingest_tokens`** — the cumulative API cost and token count spent compiling this page across all of its source files. Know which pages drove cost.

### Opening GraphML in external tools

The exported `.graphml` file can be loaded in any of these free tools:

**yEd Graph Editor** (recommended for getting started)

1. Download from [yworks.com/yed](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) (free, Windows/Mac/Linux)
2. Open yEd → **File → Open** → select your `.graphml` file
3. Apply a layout: **Layout → Hierarchical** or **Layout → Organic** for best results
4. Node labels show page titles; edges show wikilink direction

**Gephi** (recommended for large wikis and analysis)

1. Download from [gephi.org](https://gephi.org) (free, open source)
2. **File → Open** your `.graphml` file
3. Run **Layout → ForceAtlas2** in the Layout panel; enable **Prevent Overlap** in Tuning to spread nodes apart
4. To show node labels: click the **label toggle button** (marked **Aα** or **T**) in the bottom toolbar next to the Nodes slider
5. Color nodes by the `status` attribute to see which pages are `active`, `stale`, or `contradicted` at a glance
6. Use **Statistics** to compute degree centrality or community detection

**Cytoscape** (recommended for programmatic analysis)

1. Download from [cytoscape.org](https://cytoscape.org) (free)
2. **File → Import → Network from File** → select your `.graphml`
3. Apply a layout from the **Layout** menu

<a name="web-chat-ui"></a>

## Step 22 — Use the web chat UI

The `synthadoc web` command opens a browser-based chat interface for your wiki. Unlike the CLI query command, the web UI supports multi-turn conversation and shows contextual hint chips based on your session history.

### Open the web UI

```bash
synthadoc web -w history-of-computing
```

Your browser opens automatically to the web chat interface.

![Synthadoc Query Agent Web UI](png/synthadoc-query-agent-web-UI.png)

### Session modes

The UI detects the state of your wiki and your session history, then adapts:

| Mode badge | When it appears | Hint chips shown |
|---|---|---|
| **New Wiki** | Fewer than 5 wiki pages exist | Onboarding — guides you through ingesting your first documents |
| **Explorer** | ≥5 pages, first time opening the UI for this wiki | Discovery — broad overview questions to explore the wiki |
| **Health Check** | ≥5 pages, returning user, ≥1 stale page in the wiki | Lifecycle review — suggests running lint or inspecting stale pages |
| **Power User** | ≥5 pages, returning user, no stale pages | Context-sensitive follow-ups based on your last answer |

The mode badge appears in the top-right corner of the chat interface. It reflects the wiki's current state — after you run lint and promote pages, a **Health Check** session will become **Power User** on the next session open.

### Asking questions

Type a question in the text box and press **Enter** (or click **Ask**). The answer streams in word-by-word as the LLM generates it — no waiting for the full response.

Below each answer:

- **Citations** — links to the wiki pages that contributed to the answer
- **Knowledge gap callout** — appears when the wiki lacks coverage; suggests `search for:` ingest commands to fill the gap
- **Hint chips** — suggested follow-up questions based on the current answer and your session history

### Multi-turn conversation

Each question in a session builds on the previous ones. The UI maintains conversation context so follow-up questions like "What came before that?" resolve correctly against the previous answer.

### Stopping

Close the browser tab when done. The engine keeps running — use `synthadoc serve` background mode or stop the server manually when finished.

---

<a name="query-caching"></a>

## Step 23 — Query caching

`synthadoc query` (and the web chat UI) cache answers automatically. The second time you ask the same question against the same wiki, the answer returns instantly from cache without an LLM call.

### How the cache works

The cache key is a hash of:
- The question text (after normalisation)
- The current wiki **epoch** — a version counter that increments whenever you ingest new content or change a page's lifecycle state

This means cached answers are always consistent with the current wiki. A new ingest automatically invalidates old cached answers so you never see a stale result.

### Bypassing the cache

```bash
# Always call the LLM, even if the answer is cached
synthadoc query "What is Moore's Law?" --no-cache
```

Use `--no-cache` when:
- You want to verify the answer is still correct after an ingest
- You are debugging a query or testing a new LLM provider
- You suspect the cache entry is stale for any reason

The `--no-cache` flag works on both `synthadoc query` and with the `synthadoc web` UI (pass it when starting the server, or use the flag on an individual `query` CLI call).

### Cache management

The query cache lives in the same `cache.db` as the ingest response cache. Clear all cached answers at once:

```bash
synthadoc cache clear -w history-of-computing
```

> **Note:** The query cache is separate from the ingest cache layers. Clearing the cache removes both query answers and LLM responses cached during ingest — the next lint run and the next ingest of any source will re-run LLM calls.

## What's next?

You have now walked through every major Synthadoc feature on the demo wiki. When you're
ready to build a wiki for your own domain:

- **[README — Creating Your Own Wiki](../README.md#creating-your-own-wiki)** — two commands and you're running

Key differences from the demo:

- `synthadoc install <name> --target <dir> --domain "<your domain>"` generates LLM
  scaffold for your domain at install time (index categories, AGENTS.md, purpose.md)
- Drop your own source files into `raw_sources/` and run batch ingest
- Use web search to fill knowledge gaps as your wiki grows
- Schedule nightly ingests and weekly scaffold refresh to keep it current automatically

| `Synthadoc: Export Wiki` | Modal with a format dropdown (`json`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `graphml`), a full-width output path field pre-filled with today's date and the correct extension, and a status filter selector. A brief description at the top explains what each format contains. Click **Export** to write the file to your vault's `exports/` folder; the file opens automatically. For GraphML format, a **View Graph** button also appears for an inline Cytoscape.js preview — nodes are coloured by lifecycle state (active=green, draft=yellow, stale=orange, contradicted=red, archived=grey) and edges represent wikilinks. To load the graph in a dedicated tool, export to file and open in **yEd**, **Gephi**, or **Cytoscape**. |

> **UX note:** All modals are draggable and support full text selection and copy-paste.

### Ribbon icon

## Appendix B — Hooks: auto-commit wiki to git

Hooks are shell commands triggered on lifecycle events. Wire `git-auto-commit.py` so
every successful ingest produces a git commit.

### One-time setup

**1. Initialise git in the wiki root:**

```bash
cd ~/wikis/history-of-computing
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init: initial wiki snapshot"
```

**2. Copy the hook script:**

```bash
cp /path/to/synthadoc-repo/hooks/git-auto-commit.py .
```

**3. Add to `.synthadoc/config.toml`:**

```toml
[hooks]
on_ingest_complete = "python git-auto-commit.py"
```

**4. Restart the server** to pick up the config change.

### Verify

After the next ingest:

```bash
git log --oneline -3
```

```
a3f1b2c wiki: ingest konrad-zuse-z3-computer.md → created konrad-zuse
d9e4c81 wiki: ingest turing-enigma-decryption.pdf → updated alan-turing
```

> **More hooks:** see [`hooks/README.md`](../hooks/README.md) for the full library and
> contribution guidelines. Available events: `on_ingest_complete`, `on_lint_complete`.

| `opencode`    | _(none)_            | Yes — uses your Opencode subscription, no key    | No              |

> CLI providers (`claude-code`, `opencode`) require no API key but need the tool installed and authenticated in your terminal. Web search still requires `TAVILY_API_KEY`. See [Appendix G](#appendix-g--using-a-coding-tool-as-your-llm-provider) for setup details.

**Change the provider** — edit `.synthadoc/config.toml`:

```toml
# Anthropic
[agents]
default = { provider = "anthropic", model = "claude-sonnet-4-6" }

# Gemini Flash (default)
[agents]
default = { provider = "gemini", model = "gemini-2.5-flash" }

# Groq (fast free tier)
[agents]
default = { provider = "groq", model = "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" }

# MiniMax (cheapest paid, natively multimodal)
[agents]
default = { provider = "minimax", model = "MiniMax-M2.5" }
```

Restart `synthadoc serve`. The startup banner confirms `LLM: <provider>/<model>`.

> **Rate limit tips:**
>
> - **Gemini** free tier: 15 RPM. If you see `429 RateLimitError` during a long ingest, wait 60 s and retry, or switch to Groq or MiniMax.
> - **Groq** free tier: 100K tokens/day — adequate for short demo sessions; heavy web search ingest can exhaust it.
> - **MiniMax:** no free tier, but M2.5 input is ~$0.15/M tokens — roughly half the cost of Gemini 2.5 Flash. M2.5 and M2.7 are natively multimodal (text + image).
> - **Ollama:** fully local, no rate limits. Install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com); no API key needed.

## Appendix D — Tavily web search key

Web search ingestion (Step 10) requires a Tavily API key. Get a free key at
**[tavily.com](https://tavily.com)** (1,000 searches/month, no credit card required).

**Set the key:**

```bash
# Linux / macOS
export TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-your-key-here"

# Windows (cmd.exe — current session)
set TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-your-key-here

# Windows (cmd.exe — permanent)
setx TAVILY_API_KEY tvly-your-key-here
```

If this key is absent, the server starts normally but web search jobs fail with
`[ERR-SKILL-004]`. All other features work without it.

---

## Appendix E — Configuration

You do not need to configure anything to run the demo. The demo wiki ships with its own settings and sensible built-in defaults cover everything else. Set your API key env var, run `synthadoc serve`, and go.

Read this appendix when you are ready to run a real wiki or change a default.

### How configuration works

Settings are resolved in three layers — later layers win:

```
1. Built-in defaults          (always applied)
2. ~/.synthadoc/config.toml   (global — your preferences across all wikis)
3. <wiki-root>/.synthadoc/config.toml   (per-project — overrides for one wiki)
```

Neither file is required. If both are absent, the built-in defaults take effect.

### Global config — `~/.synthadoc/config.toml`

**Use this to set preferences that apply to every wiki on your machine** — primarily your default LLM provider and the wiki registry.

```toml
[agents]
default = { provider = "gemini", model = "gemini-2.5-flash" }  # free tier
lint    = { provider = "groq",   model = "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" }  # cheaper for lint

[wikis]
research = "~/wikis/research"
work     = "~/wikis/work"
```

Common reason to edit: switching from the Anthropic default to Gemini Flash (free tier) so all wikis use it without touching each project config.

### Per-project config — `<wiki-root>/.synthadoc/config.toml`

**Use this when one wiki needs different settings from the global default** — a different port, tighter cost limits, wiki-specific hooks, or web search.

```toml
[server]
port = 7071          # required if running more than one wiki simultaneously

[cost]
soft_warn_usd = 0.50
hard_gate_usd = 2.00

[ingest]
fetch_timeout_seconds = 60   # increase if slow sites time out during web search

[web_search]
provider    = "tavily"
max_results = 20

# Optional: enable semantic re-ranking (downloads ~130 MB model once)
# [search]
# vector = true
# vector_top_candidates = 20   # BM25 candidate pool before cosine re-rank

[hooks]
on_ingest_complete = "python git-auto-commit.py"
```

Common reason to edit: each wiki needs its own port when running multiple wikis at the same time.

## Appendix F — Build Your Own Wiki from scratch

This appendix walks through creating a wiki for your own domain — no demo template.

### 1. Install and scaffold

```bash
synthadoc install my-research --target ~/wikis
synthadoc scaffold -w my-research
synthadoc use my-research
```

`scaffold` prompts for a domain description and generates `wiki/index.md`,
`wiki/purpose.md`, and `AGENTS.md` (the LLM's per-ingest context document).

### 2. Start the server

```bash
synthadoc serve -w my-research
```

### 3. Ingest sources

```bash
synthadoc ingest path/to/document.pdf
synthadoc ingest "https://example.com/article"
synthadoc ingest "search for: <your domain topic>"
synthadoc jobs list
```

### 4. Query

```bash
synthadoc query "What are the key themes?"
```

### 5. Lint

```bash
synthadoc lint report
synthadoc lint run --auto-resolve
```

### 6. Open in Obsidian

Open `~/wikis/my-research` as an Obsidian vault.

### Working with multiple wikis

```bash
synthadoc use finance-wiki     # switch active wiki
synthadoc status               # checks finance-wiki
synthadoc status -w legal-wiki # one-off check without switching
synthadoc use                  # confirm which wiki is active
```


| Method                         | Scope                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `synthadoc use <name>`         | Persistent across terminal sessions |
| `export SYNTHADOC_WIKI=<name>` | Current shell session only          |
| `-w <name>` on command         | Single command only                 |

## Appendix G — Using a Coding Tool as Your LLM Provider

If you already have a **Claude Code** or **Opencode** subscription, you can use it to power Synthadoc's LLM calls — no separate API key required.

### Setup

Open `.synthadoc/config.toml` in your wiki root, comment out the active `default` line, and uncomment the one for your tool:

```toml
[agents]
# default = { provider = "claude-code" }   # no API key — uses your Claude Code subscription
# default = { provider = "opencode" }      # no API key — uses your Opencode subscription
```

The `model` field is optional — if omitted, the tool uses its own configured default. Restart the server after saving.

Ensure the tool is installed and authenticated in your terminal before starting the server. No environment variables are required.

![Switching LLM providers in config.toml — Claude Code enabled](png/synthadoc-switch-provider.png)

> **Web search still needs Tavily.** Even with a CLI provider, `search for:` ingest requires a `TAVILY_API_KEY`. The free tier (1,000 searches/month, no credit card required) is more than enough for typical Synthadoc use — see [Appendix D](#appendix-d--tavily-web-search-key).

> **Note:** CLI providers use BM25 search only — vector/semantic search (`[search] vector = true`) is not supported and will be silently bypassed.

### Demo: ingest + query

Start the server and ingest a source as normal:

```bash
synthadoc serve -w my-wiki
synthadoc ingest "https://example.com/article" -w my-wiki
synthadoc query "What does the article cover?" -w my-wiki
```

The output is identical to a direct API provider. The only difference is that each LLM call is handled by Claude Code or Opencode running as a subprocess.

> **Performance note:** CLI providers add subprocess startup overhead per LLM call. For high-volume batch ingest, a direct API provider (`anthropic`, `gemini`, etc.) is faster.

### Demo: temporary provider override

If your coding tool quota is exhausted and you need to continue ingesting, override the provider for the current server session without editing `config.toml`:

```bash
synthadoc serve -w my-wiki --provider anthropic
```

This uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or whichever provider you specify) for that session only. When quota resets, restart without `--provider` to return to the CLI provider.

### Troubleshooting

**"usage quota exhausted" error in job log:**
Your coding tool subscription has hit its usage limit. Options:

1. Wait for quota to reset (typically a few hours)
2. Retry the job: `synthadoc ingest <source> -w my-wiki`
3. Switch temporarily: `synthadoc serve -w my-wiki --provider anthropic`

**"not found in PATH" error on server start:**
Install and authenticate the coding tool first:

- Claude Code: [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
- Opencode: [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai)

## Appendix H — BM25 Routing Performance Benchmarks

Measured on Windows 11, Python 3.14, pytest-benchmark 5.2.3 (`time.perf_counter`).
Synthetic wiki with 10 branches; scoped tests search 2 branches (~20% of corpus).
Each result is the median of 5 rounds.

> **What these numbers measure:** The BM25 corpus is built from disk on the first query and then cached in memory for the lifetime of the server process. The reported medians reflect **warm-cache latency** — rounds 2–5 of each benchmark run, where all page content is already in memory. Cold-start latency (the very first query after server start, or immediately after a page write that invalidates the cache) will be higher, proportional to page count and local disk speed. On a running server handling real traffic, warm-cache numbers are representative of typical query latency.

### Scoped search (2 of 10 branches)


| Pages | Median |   Min |   Max |
| ----: | -----: | ----: | ----: |
|   100 |  14 ms |  5 ms | 36 ms |
|   500 |  16 ms |  7 ms | 19 ms |
|  1000 |   9 ms |  8 ms | 12 ms |
| 10000 |  41 ms | 39 ms | 50 ms |

Routing keeps latency nearly flat across corpus sizes — the search is bounded by branch size, not total page count.

### Full-corpus search (no routing)


| Pages | Median |    Min |    Max |
| ----: | -----: | -----: | -----: |
|   100 |   7 ms |   6 ms |  32 ms |
|   500 |  14 ms |  14 ms |  16 ms |
|  1000 |  22 ms |  21 ms |  31 ms |
| 10000 | 191 ms | 184 ms | 210 ms |

Full-corpus BM25 scales roughly linearly with page count. At 10000 pages the median is 191 ms — comfortably within a 500 ms interactive budget.

### Takeaway

For wikis under ~1000 pages the difference between scoped and full-corpus is negligible (both under 25 ms). At 10000 pages routing delivers a **4–5× speedup** (41 ms vs. 191 ms). Enable ROUTING.md ([Step 17](#step-17--set-up-routingmd--scoped-search)) once your wiki exceeds a few hundred pages.
